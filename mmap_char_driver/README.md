#mmap_char_driver

Character driver that registers a device to the kernel using standard cdev.

Supports non-blocking IO.

On every write syscall invocation, device memory is cleared, freed and reallocated.

ioctl code is defined in scull.h

The SCULL_MAGIC was obtained from an unused MAGIC number.

mmap code figures out the physical memory of the 1st block in the 1st quanta, it then gets the page frame number by shifting right with PAGE_SHIFT.
The page frame number is then used to build a page table entry with the new vm_area of the mmap calling process.

scull_ioctl.c file contains userspace support for accessing the ioctl commands and for manipulating the mmap'ed memory buffer.
If defined with MAP_PRIVATE, then user changes are not flushed to the physical memory.
If defined with MAP_SHARED, the user change is reflected.

Note, in this example, a kernel memory is being exposed to the userspace which is a big security risk in real scenarios.
Its ok for this pedagogic purpose however.
Normally mmap is used for mapping file blocks into memory and peripheral registers, video buffers to userspace.

mmap() is also used instead of brk() with MAP_ANONYMOUS settings, since there is no backing file. I think its used for dynamic memory requests of 128KB and larger.
